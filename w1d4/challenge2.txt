Composition:
    Scenario:
        In an application where you have companies which have employees

    Relationship:
        Company class
        Employee subclass

    This is a composition relationship as an Employee can't really exist outside a company


Aggregation:
    Scenario:
        In an application where you can create teams and add different accounts to that team
    
    Relationship:
        Team class
        Acount subclass

    This is an aggregation relationship because a Team cah have one/more people, but a Person can exist outside a team
