Our memoized recursive solution is quite space-inefficient due to the fact that we’re now caching every single 
answer up to the input n. Could we improve upon our recursive solution even further such that it’s more space efficient?

An easy way of improving the recursive solution is to make it iterative, as iterative solutions are more space efficient than 
recursive solutions. Also we can keep track of values for only (n-1) and (n-2) without having to have a cache that contains all values.
